#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
linear O(n) - the number of times it loops over is the same as input n

b)

Linearithmic O(n log n) - the times it runs through decrese at the same rate 

c)
its exponential because it has to run an additional time for each time bunnies != 0

## Exercise II

n story building
len(n)/2
if egg breaks at half of n, you can rule out the later half,

continue to compare half way in between new possible floors and test if > or <, continue untill you have one floor


log n since it has less times to half itself each additional comparison
