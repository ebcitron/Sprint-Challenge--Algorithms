#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

O(n) - same ammount of calculations regardless of what N is, just increased by the time it takes to multiply bigger numbers

A linear algorithm – O(n)
Runtime grows directly in proportion to n.

b)

O(nlogn) - as n increases, the runtime has to increase as well

A superlinear algorithm – O(nlogn)
Runtime grows in proportion to n.


c)

O(n) - Regardless of n number of bunnies, the function runs subtracting the two ears per each bunnie once

A linear algorithm – O(n)
Runtime grows directly in proportion to n.
